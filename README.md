# The Last Show

A full stack application with React and AWS that generates obituaries for people (fictional or otherwise). Using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to generate an obituary, [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to turn the obituary into speech, and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to store the speech and a picture of the deceased (may they rest in peace).
